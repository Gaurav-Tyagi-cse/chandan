                                </h2>

                                <p>
                                    In Singapore, pursuing architecture requires a major financial commitment. Local students pay between SGD 8,500-SGD 10,000 in tuition annually for a Bachelor of Arts in Architecture at the National University of Singapore (NUS), however, the Master’s program costs approximately SGD 10,000-SGD 13,000 per year. On the other hand, international students pay higher tuition fees, usually between SGD 30,000-SGD 40,000 per year. Supplementary expenditures entail studio fees, materials, and living costs, which can increase the overall cost of education for overseas students to more than SGD 50,000 per year. To assist in defraying these expenses, scholarships and other forms of monetary assistance are available.
