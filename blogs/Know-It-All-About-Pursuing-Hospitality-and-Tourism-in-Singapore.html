                                    What’s the cost of pursuing Hospitality and Tourism in Singapore?
                                </h2>

                                <p>
                                    Based on the institution and the particular program, the cost of pursuing a degree in Hospitality and Tourism in Singapore differs. Typically, Singaporean students pay between SGD 8,000-SGD 12,000 in tuition annually for undergraduate programs at public universities viz., Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the National University of Singapore (NUS). On the contrary, overseas students are charged considerably higher tuition fees, usually between SGD 30,000-SGD 40,000 annually. Equivalent or higher fees may be charged by private universities, with certain programs costing anything from SGD 40,000-SGD 60,000 per year.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Besides tuition, supplementary expenses viz., food, housing, transit, and individual expenditures, should also be taken into account by students. In Singapore, living expenses can be relatively expensive, with estimated monthly expenses ranging from SGD 800-SGD 2,000 based on one’s way of living and housing preferences. All in all, pursuing a Hospitality and Tourism degree in Singapore can be a major financial commitment, nevertheless the country’s distinguished universities and robust tourism sector can provide significant gains through top-notch instruction and job prospects.
