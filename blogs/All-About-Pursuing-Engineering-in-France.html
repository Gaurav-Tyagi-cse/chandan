                                <p>
                                    Based on the type of institution, the cost of pursuing an Engineering degree in France differs. The tuition fees at public universities are generally lower, usually between €200-€500 annually for EU students. Non-EU students pay up to €3,000 per year. On the contrary, tuition fees ranging from €8,000-€15,000 may be charged by renowned engineering schools viz., the Grandes Écoles annually. Moreover, students should also set aside money for living expenses, which, based on the city and his/her way of living can cost between €600-€1,200 every month. To assist in defraying these expenses, scholarships and funding alternatives may be available.
