Public universities may charge between €500-€4,000 in tuition annually for EU students, while non-EU students may pay higher tuition fees, generally costing between €1,500 and €5,000 per year. Private universities on the contrary are generally more costly, with tuition fees costing between €6,000-€20,000 per year.
