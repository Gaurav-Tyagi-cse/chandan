<p>Indian students have a lot to gain from <b>studying in Germany</b> since German institutions are well regarded and appreciated for their first-rate calibre. You will have the finest learning experience ever thanks to their cutting-edge facilities, a wide range of funding alternatives, research-based courses, award-winning curricula, varied and active student community, and distinctive lifestyle. These characteristics have made Germany a destination for gifted overseas students looking to develop their academic and research capabilities. And a large number of Indian students are included in this group of academics.</p>



<p>Aspiring MBA students can choose from some of the best programmes offered in Germany. Indian and other international students, as well as hopefuls, are becoming more and more interested in <b> German MBA degrees.</b> 4,00,000 international students are reportedly enrolled in higher education programmes in Germany, and the number may possibly be greater given that the majority of them intend to remain and find employment there when they graduate. One of the main draws is the relatively reduced cost of living and attending school in Germany, as well as the availability of funding and promising job possibilities.</p>


<h2>Why choose to study MBA in Germany?</h2>


<p>The cost of an MBA in Germany is reasonable. The largest portion of education costs in Germany are <b> MBA tuition fees.</b> Top private German business schools provide higher education at a very affordable tuition rate in Germany. The cost of <b> an MBA at a public institution in Germany</b> is reasonable. The educational standards in Germany are also quite good, in addition to the comparably affordable MBA costs for overseas students. Eight German business schools were rated among the top 100 for full-time management courses in the 2020 Financial Times' European Business School Rankings. The QS Global MBA Rankings for 2021 include five German business schools. Four of these institutes were included among the top 100 business schools worldwide. There are plenty of job chances since, according to the Association of German Chambers of Commerce & Industry, Germany needs 15 lakh qualified workers from other countries.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Executive MBA programme in Germany offers the best career and compensation opportunities for alums and graduates of the country's top colleges.</p>

<h2> Part-time Employment and Payscale after an MBA: </h2>
<p align="justify">Only those having a German student visa are permitted entry into Germany as international students. In addition to providing the students with various advantages, it also enables them to work part-time while finishing their education. However, there are several guidelines that you must follow when seeking for part-time work.</p>


<p>While enrolled in a course in Germany, international students are permitted to work 240 half-days or 120 full-days.</p>

<p>International students who work part-time are not permitted to engage in self-employment or freelancing. According to the regulations established by the majority of universities, overseas students are not allowed to work more than 20 hours per week throughout their term.</p>

<p>Students who make less than Euro 450 per month or who work fewer than 50 days in a year are exempt from paying taxes.</p>

<p>The top part-time occupations in Germany for foreign students include: English tutor to German students, Graduate/ Research Assistant at the university, Industrial Production Assistant, Staff at cafeterias, restaurants, gyms, etc.</p>

Working part-time while a student in Germany will net you a minimum wage of â‚¬9.50 per hour. This pay can change depending on the city you live in and the type of work you do.

<p>Once your course has ended, you can submit an application for an 18-month residence visa and start looking for a position that matches your credentials. You are free to work any job you choose during this time to earn money for your job hunt. But keep in mind that your chances of obtaining a residence visa in Germany for employment solely depend on your credentials and line of work.</p>
