                            <p>
                                Based on the institution and the student’s nationality, the cost of pursuing Engineering in the Netherlands differs. For a Bachelor’s degree, EU/EEA students pay between €2,314-€4,500 in tuition annually, while the tuition fees for non-EU/EEA students are higher, usually between €6,000-€20,000 per year. On the other hand, the fee structures for Master’s programs are typically comparable, with EU/EEA students paying approximately €2,314-€4,500 annually and non-EU/EEA students paying between €8,000 and €20,000 per year. Living expenses, which are estimated to cost between €800-€1,200 monthly, and cover food, accommodation, insurance, and other individual expenditures, are not entailed in these costs.

                                        A number of engineering programs, particularly at the master’s level, are available in English. Bachelor’s programs in English are also available, nevertheless, they may be fewer that those taught in Dutch.

                                        EU/EEA students do not require a visa to study in Netherlands. On the contrary, non-EU/EEA students require a student visa (MVV) and a residence permit to study in the country. The host university usually helps with the application procedure.
