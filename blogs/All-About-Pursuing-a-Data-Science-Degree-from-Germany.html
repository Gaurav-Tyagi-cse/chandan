                            <p>
                            Based on the type of institution (public or private) and the degree of study (bachelor's, master's, or doctoral), the cost of pursuing Data Science in Germany can differ substantially. At public universities, both EU and non-EU students are charged typically low or no tuition fees, although a minimal semester fee usually between €100-€400, covering administrative costs and at times, public transport may be charged.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                            On the contrary, tuition fees usually between €10,000-€20,000 annually may be charged by private universities. Besides tuition, costs of living generally ranging from €800-€1,200 per month, and including food, housing, health insurance, and other individual expenditures need to be taken into account. Cities viz., Frankfurt and Munich are generally more costly, whereas cities viz., Dresden or Leipzig are more budget-friendly. To assist in alleviating these expenses, scholarships and part-time employment possibilities are also offered.
