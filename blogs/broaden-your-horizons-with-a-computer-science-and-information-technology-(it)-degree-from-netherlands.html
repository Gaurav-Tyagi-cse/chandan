EU/EEA students generally pay about €2,314 in tuition annually for bachelor's programs at public universities. On the contrary, the tuition fees for non-EU/EEA students can be higher, usually costing between €6,000-€15,000 annually for bachelor's programs and €8,000-€20,000 annually for master's programs, based on the university and particular course. Moreover, students should also set aside money for living expenses,  which can cost between €800-€1,200 per month, covering food, housing, transit, and other individual expenses.
