<p align="justify">Australia has a strong focus on both engineering as well as in environmental studies (sustainable). Studying in Australia goes beyond traditional classroom limit. With a focus on interdisciplinary collaboration, students could explore a connection between engineering, environmental science, and sustainability. This gives a holistic environment for studying and understanding the various aspects of the industry. Engineering and environmental studies in Australia is a unique branch of study. Focusing on subjects like biology, hydrology, microbiology, geology, mathematics and various engineering related subjects, this field has many unique opportunities.</p>

<h2> Why study Engineering in Australia? </h2>

<p align="justify">Engineering and technology have consistently been the most popularly pursued program in Australia due to its strong mining and technology sectors. The programs prepare students with various specialisations or branches of engineering such as civil, chemical, electrical, and mechanical engineering, along with specialisations in railway, mining, automotive, electronics, transportation, and telecommunications. An engineering degree from Australia opens various opportunities like further studies and employment. Typically, the universities focus on theoretical and practicality on the subject. The benefits of studying engineering are as follows:</p>

<ul class="blog-list">
<li>Students can <strong>study engineering in Australia</strong> and gain industry insights through internship programmes</li>
<li>A wide range of <strong>courses in Australia</strong> like engineering courses from mechanical, agricultural, aerospace, electronics, and even chemical industries are offered by <strong>Australian universities</strong> to students worldwide</li>
<li>Students studying engineering in Australia can look forward to excellent employment prospects after completing their studies.</li>
